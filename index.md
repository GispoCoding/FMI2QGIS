### 24H ENFUSER air quality animation
![24 hours of ENFUSER air quality information](./thumbnails/enfuser_24h.gif?raw=true)

This short animation shows how air quality index changes in 24 hours in Helsinki region. Darker colors in the visualization indicate lower air quality index. The data is a forecast. Impact of traffic can be clearly seen in the animation. This data is collected in one 24 hour period in April 2021.

### Average NO2 emissions in Helsinki
![3D NO2 emissions](./thumbnails/3dno2.gif?raw=true)

In this visualization user can view modelled nitrogen dioxide concentrations from 2019 in Helsinki region. Nitrogen dioxide mostly comes from traffic exhaust gases. Higher peaks and brighter colors indicate higher average emissions. User can pan and zoom around the map.

### Global PM 2.5 pollution
![PM2.5](./thumbnails/pm25.gif?raw=true)
 
PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. PM 2.5 can be dust, pollen or other fine particles which affect air quality. In the visualization darker shades of black indicate higher density of PM 2.5 pollution. Desert areas are clearly highlighted in the animation, which shows 5 day forecast in April 2021.

### Global CO emissions
![CO emissions](./thumbnails/co.gif?raw=true)
 
Carbon monoxide (CO) is produced in the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, oil, coal, and wood. Map clearly highlights the most densely populated areas in the world and brighter colors on the map indicate higher levels of CO emissions. . The map shows a 5 day period in April 2021.

### Global NO2 emissions
![NO2 emissions](./thumbnails/no2.gif?raw=true)

NO2 is produced when fossil fuels (coal, natural gas and so on) are burned. Darker colors on the map indicate higher levels of emissions in the forecast. The map shows a 5 day period in April 2021. Global shipping routes can be clearly seen from the animation. You can clearly see how time of day has a clear effect on the NO2 emission forecast as the color changes brighter from east to west in the animation.

### Global SO2 emissions
![SO2 emissions](./thumbnails/so2.gif?raw=true)

Looks like the world is on fire, but actually this map is showing similar emissions as the ones before. Also sulfur dioxide (SO2) originates from burning fossil fuels. Brighter colors on the map indicate higher levels of SO2 emissions in the SILAM forecast. The map shows a 5 day period in April 2021.

### PM 2.5 pollution in Helsinki region in 3D
![ PM 2.5 pollution](./imgs/pm25_3200x1600.png?raw=true)

This rendering of annual (2019) PM 2.5 levels in Helsinki region shows an exaggerated three dimensional view. Higher peaks indicate higher level of pollution and main traffic corridors are clearly highlighted, especially in the full resolution version aims

### Carbon sinks in Helsinki region
![ Carbon sinks](./imgs/pm25_3200x1600.png?raw=true)

A carbon sinks are reservoirs which accumulate and store some carbon-containing chemical compound. Carbon sinks have a connection to better air quality and this map visualizes carbon sinks in Helsinki region. Forest areas are clearly highlighted e.g. in Nuuksio in Espoo as well as Helsinki Central Park.
